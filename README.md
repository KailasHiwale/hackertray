HackerTray is a simple [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) Linux application
that lets you view top HN stories in your System Tray. It relies on appindicator, so
it is not guaranteed to work on all systems. It also provides a Gtk StatusIcon fallback
in case AppIndicator is not available.

The inspiration for this came from [Hacker Bar](http://hackerbarapp.com), which is 
Mac-only. I tried to port it to `node-webkit`, but had to do it in Python instead
because nw doesn't support AppIndicators yet.

##Installation
HackerTray is distributed as a python package. Do the following to install:

``` sh
sudo pip install hackertray
OR
sudo easy_install hackertray
OR
#Download Source and cd to it
sudo python setup.py install
```

After that, you can run `hackertray` from anywhere and it will run. You can
now add it to your OS dependent session autostart method. In Ubuntu, you can
access it via: 

1. System > Preferences > Sessions  
(OR)
2. System > Preferences > Startup Applications 

depending on your Ubuntu Version. Or put it in `~/.config/openbox/autostart` 
if you are running OpenBox. [Here](http://imgur.com/mnhIzDK) is how the 
configuration should look like in Ubuntu and its derivatives. 

###Upgrade
The latest stable version is always the one [available on pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/hackertray/).
You can check which version you have installed with `pip freeze | grep hackertray`.

To upgrade, run `pip install -U hackertray`. In some cases (Ubuntu), you might
need to clear the pip cache before upgrading:

`sudo rm -rf /tmp/pip-build-root/hackertray`

##Features
1. Minimalist Approach to HN
2. Opens links in your default browser
3. Remembers which links you opened
4. Shows Points/Comment count in a simple format

###Troubleshooting

If the app indicator fails to show in Ubuntu versions, consider installing 
python-appindicator with

`sudo apt-get install python-appindicator`
